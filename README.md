# DBSCAN Cluster Analysis

This project implements the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm using Python.
The algorithm identifies clusters based on data density and effectively detects outliers.
The implementation is demonstrated using a sample dataset and visualized using Matplotlib.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to view clustering results
